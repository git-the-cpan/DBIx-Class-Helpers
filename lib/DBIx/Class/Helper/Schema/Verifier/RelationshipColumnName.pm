=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Helper::Schema::Verifier::RelationshipColumnName - Verify that relationships and column names are distinct

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package MyApp::Schema;

 __PACKAGE__->load_components('Helper::Schema::Verifier::RelationshipColumnName');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<DBIx::Class::Helper::Schema::Verifier::RelationshipColumnName> verifies that
none of your columns have the same name as a relationship.  If you create a
relationship that has the same name as a column, to access the column you will
be forced to use C<get_column>, additionally it is just confusing having them
be the same name.  What I tend to do is define the columns to be something like
C<user_id> and have the relationship then be simply C<user>.
